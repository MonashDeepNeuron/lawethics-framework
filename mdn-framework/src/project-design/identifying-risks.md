# Identifying Risks
When considering how a project might pose an ethical risk, it is important to account for the fact that AI and computer systems are ‘socio-technical’ in nature, meaning that what might appear to be objective and technical components are nonetheless influenced by social factors during both its creation and implementation.

Below are eight questions that can act as a guide in identifying and assessing ethical risks relating to a project.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Human, Societal And <br>Environmental<br>Wellbeing<br><br>Is the platform/product<br>actually providing a<br>social good?</th>
    <th>AI and computer systems should benefit individuals, society, and the environment.<br><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Teams should outline the AI systems objectives, including the merits of achieving its outcomes.</li>
    <li>Teams are encouraged to consider how the AI systems affect people, and how it will benefit them, not harm them.<br> Ask yourself, "what social cause does the product go towards furthering?"</li> 
    <li>For example, this can be as simple as AI systems which improve internal business processes (e.g. efficiency)
    </li> </ul>
    <br><br></th>
