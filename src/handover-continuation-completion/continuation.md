# Continuation
## Review Meeting
Where a project is still in development and will not be handed over to another branch for the next project season, a review meeting will still take place but without the need for onboarding an incoming Manager.

The purpose of this meeting is for the Branch Lead, the Project Manager, and a member of the Law & Ethics Committee to:
- Review and update the projectâ€™s <u>Statement of Compatibility </u>
- Evaluate how key ethical considerations were addressed over the project lifetime
- Discuss any new key ethical considerations to arise in the future development of the project and how they will be addressed.
