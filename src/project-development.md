# Project Development
> _This section provides for the integration of previous stages of ethical consideration into the development of a project by the team members to whom it is allocated._

During the development phase of a project, Project Managers and other team members join the Branch Lead in the ethical consideration process. When they are being briefed on the project they have been allocated to, this will involve a team induction in which the Project Manager leads a group discussion on the ethical risks, with reference to the mitigation strategies outlined in the risk assessment tool.

Over the course of the development phase — typically a 12-week semester — each Project Manager will have one 30-minute check-in meeting with the Law & Ethics Committee to discuss how the project is progressing from an ethical perspective. This will take place approximately halfway through the project season, but the Committee is available for ongoing consultation when needed throughout the rest of the development period.
